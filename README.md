Here are some insights I accumulated based the dataset:

- 0-1 year tenure is your biggest customer group, but also your biggest concern in term of churning as they have the highest rate of dropping the contract at 48.28%. However, churn rate reduced over time

-→ This suggested that onboarding and engagement strategy should be improved.

- Electronic checks is the most used payment method but customers using this also tend to churn at 57%. Banks transfer and credit cards (automatic) are more stable. People are moving towards paperless billing as well (59%)

-→ Digital-first experience should be promoted as the shift in customer preferences and reducing risk of churn

- Month-to-month contract is at the highest risk of churning (almost 90% people who churned signed this contract). Mid-range monthly charges ($45-$105) have higher churn risk, this could due to price dissatisfaction

-→ Upselling contract upgrades or financial incentives for long-term subscriptions could improve retention

- People with fibre optic internet service tend to have technical problems. Once users have to deal with tech tickets, they have an almost 70% churn rate.

-→ Improve technical care is very important. It not only reduces the number of tickets but also improve customer satisfaction with the service

In conclusion, I believe that these should be implemented to improve customer retention: 

✅ Improve retention for early-stage customers (0-1 year tenure).
✅ Incentivize customers to move from month-to-month to yearly contracts.
✅ Identify and resolve key admin & tech support pain points to reduce churn.
✅ Target electronic check users with alternative, more stable payment options.
